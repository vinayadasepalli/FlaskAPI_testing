from api import app, db  # Import the Flask application 'app' and the SQLAlchemy database object 'db' from the 'api' module.

# 'with app.app_context():' creates an application context.
# An application context is necessary when you want to use Flask extensions like SQLAlchemy outside of a request context.
# This ensures that Flask knows which application is being used and that the necessary configurations are loaded.
with app.app_context():
    # 'db.create_all()' creates all the database tables defined by your SQLAlchemy models.
    # It checks for existing tables and only creates those that don't exist.
    # This is essential before you start using your database.
    db.create_all()

#Explanation:
#1. Imports: The code imports the flask application and database objects from the api.py file.
#2. Application Context: The with statement creates a context, that allows the flask application to be accessed outside of a request.
#3. Database Creation: The db.create_all() command creates all the tables defined in the models.py file, which are linked to the db object.
#This script is commonly used to initialize the database when the application is first run.
